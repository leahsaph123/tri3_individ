## 5.3-5.4
### 5.3 Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases
- there may be biases written into algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should try to reduce bias in algorithms 
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.

### 5.3 Github Page Assignment
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? no
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion. I'd say no because HP is likely trying to sell to everyone.
- How do you think this happened? There was probably not enough diversity in the testing and development groups that they used and that is why the computer doesn't work the way it was meant to.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? no and no
- Should it be corrected? yes
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? redo the testing in order for it to be more accurate with more than one skin type

### 5.4 Crowdsourcing
- if more people can test different programs then it will likely work better
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

### 5.4 Github Page Assignment
- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Mr. M could have the whole class test something and that could ensure that the program works properly
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing? DN crowdsourcing could be better because there are more people and a broader range of people to test and give ideas/results

## 5.1-5.2

### 5.1 Harmful Effects of Computing
- Accelerometer- used to detect or control acceleration or orientation of an object
- People build on stuff that has already been done
- Multirotor-
- Benefit: delivery, finding people, aerial photos
- Harmful: flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy
- Not every effect of an innovation is anticipated
- 3d printers can be used for schools and prosthetics
- Internet can cause loss of sleep, depression, anxiety, etc
- Consider unintended consequences of what you make
- Computing innovations can be used differently then intended
- Microtransactions
- “Free” games/apps
- Paywall to functionality, pay-to-win, currency that costs money
- Not possible to consider all ways that something will be used
- Having  lots of users will change the effects of the program

### 5.1 Github Page Assignment
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
benefits- connect with others, meet people different from you
harmful- loss of connection with those around you irl
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
There is a balance between healthy and unhealthy. If you spend too much time on video games you can lose touch with real life

### 5.2 Digital divide
- Differing access to computers/internet depending on socioeconomic status, geographic location, demographics, etc
- Demographics: age, religion
- Countries: censorship
- Use internet to help the government
- Rural areas have less access to internet

### 5.2
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Learn how to code and how computers work
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Teach others how to code, help others get access to computers
Is paper or red tape (beauracracy) blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
the wifi at DN blocks a lot of things that could help us or blocks our own websites
