### 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
- Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization.
- Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use.
- Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property.
- The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one’s own is plagiarism and may have legal consequences.
- Some examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else include:
- Creative Commons—a public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. This is used when the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use, and build upon the work they have created.
- open source—programs that are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
- open access—online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
- The use of material created by someone other than you should always be cited.
- Creative Commons, open source, and open access have enabled broad access to digital information.
- As with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups of people raises legal and ethical concerns.
- Computing can play a role in social and political issues, which in turn often raises legal and ethical concerns.
- The digital divide raises ethical concerns around computing.
- Computing innovations can raise legal and ethical concerns. Some examples of these include:
-- the development of software that allows access to digital media downloads and streaming
-- the development of algorithms that include bias
-- the existence of computing devices that collect and analyze data by continuously monitoring activities

### 5.5 Github Page Assignment
- there's a lot of licenses, need the right license in order to make money off their patents
- MIT license- allowed to use code freely, closed source versions
- GPL license- can do anything except closed source versions
- I picked MIT license so that we can distribute everything but keep it protected

### 5.6 Safe Computing
- Personally identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual that identifies, links, relates, or describes them. Examples of PII include: Social Security number, age, race, phone number(s), medical information, financial information
- Search engines can record and maintain a history of searches made by users.
- Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages.
- Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user’s location.
- Technology enables the collection, use, and exploitation of information about, by, and for individuals, groups, and institutions.
- Search engines can use search history to suggest websites or for targeted marketing.
- Disparate personal data, such as geolocation, cookies, and browsing history, can be aggregated to create knowledge about an individual.
- PII and other information placed online can be used to enhance a user’s online experiences.
- PII stored online can be used to simplify making online purchases.
- Commercial and governmental curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored.
- Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact. For example, an email message may be forwarded, tweets can be retweeted, and social media posts can be viewed by potential employers.
- PII can be used to stalk or steal the identity of a person or to aid in the planning of other criminal acts.
- Once information is placed online, it is difficult to delete.
- Programs can collect your location and record where you have been, how you got there, and how long you were at a given location.
- Information posted to social media services can be used by others. Combining information posted on social media and other sources can be used to deduce private information about you.

### 5.6 Github Page Assignment
1. our names are on our projects, school
2. I'm pretty exposed but I think it's really hard not to be
3. strong passwords are hard to guess, two-factor authentication, security questions, email confirmation things, duo are used for authentication
4. symmetric-one key is used to encrypt and decrypt something, asymmetric- aka public key cryptography, there's a public and private key that are used to decrypt and encrypt information
5. public key through aws
6. phishing- emails from a prince telling you that you got money

## 5.3-5.4
### 5.3 Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases
- there may be biases written into algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should try to reduce bias in algorithms 
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.

### 5.3 Github Page Assignment
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? no
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion. I'd say no because HP is likely trying to sell to everyone.
- How do you think this happened? There was probably not enough diversity in the testing and development groups that they used and that is why the computer doesn't work the way it was meant to.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? no and no
- Should it be corrected? yes
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? redo the testing in order for it to be more accurate with more than one skin type

### 5.4 Crowdsourcing
- if more people can test different programs then it will likely work better
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

### 5.4 Github Page Assignment
- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Mr. M could have the whole class test something and that could ensure that the program works properly
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing? DN crowdsourcing could be better because there are more people and a broader range of people to test and give ideas/results

## 5.1-5.2

### 5.1 Harmful Effects of Computing
- Accelerometer- used to detect or control acceleration or orientation of an object
- People build on stuff that has already been done
- Multirotor-
- Benefit: delivery, finding people, aerial photos
- Harmful: flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy
- Not every effect of an innovation is anticipated
- 3d printers can be used for schools and prosthetics
- Internet can cause loss of sleep, depression, anxiety, etc
- Consider unintended consequences of what you make
- Computing innovations can be used differently then intended
- Microtransactions
- “Free” games/apps
- Paywall to functionality, pay-to-win, currency that costs money
- Not possible to consider all ways that something will be used
- Having  lots of users will change the effects of the program

### 5.1 Github Page Assignment
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
benefits- connect with others, meet people different from you
harmful- loss of connection with those around you irl
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
There is a balance between healthy and unhealthy. If you spend too much time on video games you can lose touch with real life

### 5.2 Digital divide
- Differing access to computers/internet depending on socioeconomic status, geographic location, demographics, etc
- Demographics: age, religion
- Countries: censorship
- Use internet to help the government
- Rural areas have less access to internet

### 5.2
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Learn how to code and how computers work
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Teach others how to code, help others get access to computers
Is paper or red tape (beauracracy) blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
the wifi at DN blocks a lot of things that could help us or blocks our own websites
