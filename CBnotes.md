Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
benefits- connect with others, meet people different from you
harmful- loss of connection with those around you irl

Learn how to code and how computers work
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
