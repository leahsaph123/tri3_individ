## 5.3-5.4
### 5.3 Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.

### 5.4 Crowdsourcing
- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
- Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
- Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
- Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.

Learn how to code and how computers work
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Teach others how to code, help others get access to computers
Is paper or red tape (beauracracy) blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
the wifi at DN blocks a lot of things that could help us or blocks our own websites
