## Github Pages assignment 5.1-5.2

### 5.1
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
benefits- connect with others, meet people different from you
harmful- loss of connection with those around you irl

There is a balance between healthy and unhealthy. If you spend too much time on video games you can lose touch with real life

How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Learn how to code and how computers work
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Teach others how to code, help others get access to computers
Is paper or red tape (beauracracy) blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
the wifi at DN blocks a lot of things that could help us or blocks our own websites

## Create Task
Our plan for the create task is to create a Planning website similar to Notion.
We will make it a combination between MyConnect, the CSP website, a scrumboard, and an individual planner.

### Jekyll Themes
