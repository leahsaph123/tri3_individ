## Week 0 Review Ticket
[Review Ticket](https://github.com/leahsaph123/tri3_individ/issues/1)

## Create Task Plan
My plan for the create task is to make a program that runs a quiz on different pop culture references for a user to take and answer. The program will give the user a result on how well they did.

## Data Structures Project
My group is planning to create a planning website that allows for students and teachers to have an online planner. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/parkjessie/LAJ#readme)
However, if the Attendance office has a project that we can do for them, then we will do that instead.
