## Create Task Plan
My plan for the create task is to make a program that runs a quiz on different pop culture references for a user to take and answer. The program will give the user a result on how well they did.

## Data Structures Project
My group is planning to create an automatic way for the attendance office to conduct contact tracing. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/parkjessie/LAJ#readme)

## Tech Talk 1
- collection data structures- any structure that holds more than one value
- class- structure that contains attributes and methods
- access methods with a "dot notation"
- can use "get method" for lists
- infoDB.append --> append is a method, denoted by the "."
- a while loop needs you to take care of the counter but you don't need to in a for loop
- a recursive function is a function that can call itself
